    Error system:
        - varlen errors
        - some system for catching errors
        - somehow handle that ERCONNECT error

    General:
        - think of something about saving player data
        - NBT translator(?) !!!
        - chunk system
        - chunk saving
        - spawning of player
        - player movement

    Networking:
        - legacy server ping resonse
        - add rest of packets to packet lists
        - data types
            - some system for arrays
            - make int handle negative numbers
            - more complicated type
            - add rest of them
            - FLOATS


    optimizations:
        - data types
        - check if _int_d can be implemented in other parts of the code (reverse() function)
